# IOT-BASED-CITY-POLLUTION-MONITORING
 The system to watch the air of environment using Arduino microcontroller, IOT Technology is proposed to measure quality of air. With the utilization of IOT technology, the method of monitoring various aspects of environment like air quality monitoring issue  can be done and it has been retrieved when and wherever it is required. The MQ135 gas sensor gives the sense of various sorts of dangerous gases and Arduino is  the heart of this mechanism which controls the whole process.dht11 reads humidity and temperature of its surrounding. both are wifi enabled through node mcu(firmware) ie esp 8266. The data then is transfered and stored in google firebase through object we created as root.our future plans are to make a web app that will display the air quality, temperature and humidity in real time and we will use ec2 enhance as faster and secured server.
